# Sticky Notes App Frontend Friday Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the Frontend Friday Challenge organized by Women Who Code. The challenge was to implement the UI for as Sticky Notes App.

## Challenge Description

The challenge required implementing a responsive web page for a Sticky Notes App based on a Figma file. The challenge also suggests to add some JavaScript functionalities. The web page includes a sticky notes section, a plus button, a text box a a "Add Sticky Note" button.

## Design Specification

Refer to this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/nDqzaOVXKwSA7RMILi8rOx/Sticky-notes-creator?type=design&node-id=201-7&t=3T0a5wFgR0UN6xS3-0) for the design specifications, including the layout, typography, colors, and any specific design elements required.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- React

## Approach

I followed the given design specification and utilized modern HTML, CSS, and React techniques to create the responsive web page. Here's a brief overview of my approach:

1. Created the React components according to the different sections of the landing page.
2. Styled the components using CSS, focusing on layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.
3. Implemented useState hooks for interactive elements.

## Features Implemented

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- A click on the "+" button triggers the text box and the "Add Sticky Notes" button appearance
- A click on the "Add Sticky Notes" button triggers the creation of a new sticky note and makes the text box and the "Add Sticky Notes" button disappear. 
- The new sticky note has a random color chosen out of the 4 colors shown on the Figma file design.
